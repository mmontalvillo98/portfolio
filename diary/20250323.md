1. Created *environments* folder and *environment.ts* file, where I plan to add all the project information for the first version of the portfolio. 
2. Created **footer component** (The footer of the page and also the contact section).
3. Added *footer.component* to *app.component*.
4. Added *fortawesome* free package:
  - Installed with: `npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`
  - Added "node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css" to *angular.json* styles
